# Homebrew Bottle Distribution

This document describes how Xberg bottles are built, distributed, and maintained.

## What are Homebrew Bottles?

Homebrew bottles are pre-compiled binaries packaged for specific macOS/Linux platforms. They provide:

- **Fast installation**: ~10 seconds vs. 5-15 minutes compiling from source
- **Reduced build dependencies**: No need for Rust, CMake, or pkg-config on the user's machine
- **Reliable builds**: Consistent binary across installations on the same platform

## Supported Platforms

Pre-built bottles are available for:

- **macOS ARM64 (Sequoia)** - Latest Apple Silicon Macs
- **macOS ARM64 (Sonoma)** - Apple Silicon Macs (2021+)
- **macOS Intel (Ventura)** - Intel-based Macs running Ventura or later
- **Linux x86_64** - Standard 64-bit Linux systems

## How Bottles are Built

### Local Bottle Creation

To build a bottle for your current platform:

```bash
cd homebrew-tap
./scripts/build-bottles.sh
```

This script:

1. Installs xberg with `--build-bottle` flag (optimized for binary distribution)
2. Runs `brew bottle` to generate the bottle file (.tar.gz)
3. Outputs the SHA256 hash needed for the formula

### CI/CD Bottle Creation

Bottles should be built in CI for each target platform:

1. **Linux x86_64**: Build on Ubuntu (GitHub Actions or similar)
2. **macOS ARM64**: Build on GitHub Actions' `macos-latest-large` runner
3. **macOS Intel**: Build on GitHub Actions' `macos-13` runner (Intel)

Each build should:

```bash
brew install --build-bottle xberg
brew bottle xberg
```

The resulting `.tar.gz` file and the output from `brew bottle` will provide the SHA256 hash.

## Updating the Formula

When bottles are ready for release:

1. **Get SHA256 hashes** from `brew bottle` output for each platform
2. **Update `Formula/xberg.rb`**:

   ```ruby
   bottle do
     root_url "https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg/releases/download/vX.Y.Z"
     sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, arm64_sequoia: "actual_hash_here"
     sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, arm64_sonoma: "actual_hash_here"
     sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, ventura: "actual_hash_here"
     sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, x86_64_linux: "actual_hash_here"
   end
   ```

3. **Update `root_url`** to point to the release version
4. **Upload bottles** to GitHub Releases under the corresponding version tag
5. **Test locally**: `brew install xberg` should use the bottle, not build from source

## Release Checklist

When releasing a new version with bottles:

- [ ] Build bottles for all 4 platforms
- [ ] Verify bottle SHA256 hashes
- [ ] Upload `.tar.gz` files to GitHub Releases
- [ ] Update `Formula/xberg.rb` with new version, SHA256, and bottle hashes
- [ ] Update `root_url` in bottle block to new release tag
- [ ] Test installation: `brew install xberg` (should use bottle)
- [ ] Verify no build dependencies required: `brew deps xberg` (should be empty)
- [ ] Commit and push changes to homebrew-tap repository

## Troubleshooting

### Installation uses source build instead of bottle

1. Check macOS/Linux version matches supported platforms
2. Verify SHA256 hashes in formula are correct
3. Confirm bottles exist at the `root_url` with correct filenames
4. Run `brew tap --repair xberg-io/tap` to refresh tap cache

### Bottle is missing a platform

Add placeholders to the formula and schedule a CI build for that platform:

```ruby
sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, arm64_ventura: "will_update_after_build"
```

Then update with real hash after the build completes.

### Need to rebuild bottles

- Increment patch version if fixing a bug
- Or use a release candidate tag (e.g., `v4.0.0-rc.19`)
- Rebuild bottles and upload to new release
- Update formula with new version and hashes
