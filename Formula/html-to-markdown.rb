  # macOS is Apple Silicon only -- the CLI no longer ships an x86_64-apple-darwin build.
  # The url MUST stay at on_macos scope rather than inside an on_arm block. Homebrew
  # validates a formula under EVERY os/arch pair, so an Intel-macOS simulation that finds no
  # url at all fails with "formula requires at least a URL", which `brew tap` then reports as
  # "Cannot tap xberg-io/tap: invalid syntax in tap!". One unreachable platform on this one
  # formula made the entire tap untappable for everyone and blocked every bottle build in the
  # org (alef 0.89.0). `depends_on arch: :arm64` is what refuses an Intel install, with an
  # accurate message. Check with `brew readall --os=all --arch=all xberg-io/tap`.
